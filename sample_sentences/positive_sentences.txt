this compelling story with gut-wrenching impact .
this may not have the dramatic gut-wrenching impact of other holocaust films , but it's a compelling story , mainly because of the way it's told by the people who were there .
a perfect example .
well-intentioned movie making .
It was too long but entertaining .
the sound , the music , and all the effects were effective , and the last hour kept us entertained .
it is a film that will be discussed and debated for years to come .
everyone is so happy , basking in the glow of overnight success , marvelling at it all--except toward the end , but even then the tone quickly reverts to sweetness , ending on an appropriately feel-good note .
we not only feel more involved in the story , but we feel like we're seeing the beginning of a saga that we have cherished for years .
i also really liked the soundtrack and the pace of the film , both of which zipped and zagged , and established a nice rhythm to it all .
