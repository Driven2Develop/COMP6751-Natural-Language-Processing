He gave her an ugly sweater .
I saw a dull and scary movie .
It was a mess and a hazard .
manipulative movie making .
shamelessly manipulative movie making .
it's a compelling story , but it has low impact .
well-intentioned but manipulative movie making .
a perfect example of well-intentioned but manipulative movie making .
a perfect example of rancid , well-intentioned , but shamelessly manipulative movie making .
the story itself is ludicrous and uninteresting and so are its elements .
however this movie's execution is completely unacceptable .
the dialogue is probably the worst i have ever seen in any movie , mainly because the whole movie depends on the boring script and the ridiculous words these characters use is what hollywood thinks kids can relate to .
the result is a wild cornucopia of images that amount to precisely nil -- even the action scenes don't work .
not surprisingly , the nighttime forest frenzy does not go unnoticed and when two girls fail to wake the following morning , witches are invoked by those eager to blame .
it is unsuccessful because not only is the boxing theme dull , but the side story of the two guys and a girl travelling across the country is even worse .
