Following the paper trail
A mill 30 kilometres east of Ottawa is our first stop on a quest to explore the environmental impact
of producing a newspaper that's read by 290,000 Montrealers every weekday (345,000 on Saturdays).

The mill 30 kilometres east of Ottawa is our first stop on a quest to explore the environmental
impact of producing a newspaper that's read by 290,000 Montrealers every weekday (345,000 on
Saturdays) | and costs the equivalent of 186,816 trees a year.
Papier Masson supplies 80 per cent of the newsprint, made from wood chips, on which The
Gazette is printed. The other 20 per cent comes from Atlantic Paper, a producer of 100-per-cent
recycled newsprint in Toronto.
Wendy Desmarteaux, The Gazette's vicepresident of operations, says Papier Masson is a pre-
ferred supplier because of p\rice and the newsprint's excellent runnability | uniform texture and
ability to hold ink.
It requires much less energy to produce recycled newsprint but costs the same because of the
high cost of waste paper and the expense of removing glass and plastic from it, according to Gerry
Murray, Atlantic's director of mills.
\Plastic bottles are our nemesis," Murray says.
Papier Masson's customers also include the Ottawa Citizen, National Post, USA Today, Denver
Post and other papers as far afield as Egypt and Brazil.
In 2000, the mill, now owned by White Birch Paper of Greenwich, Conn., invested $158 million
in a thermomechanical pulper that churns out 760 metric tonnes of wood pulp every day.
It feeds a paper machine that produces 665 tonnes of newsprint daily | enough to print two
5
weeks' worth of The Gazette.
The investment transformed an old-fashioned, foul-smelling mill into one of the most efficient in
Canada, says Bussiere, an Ecole Polytechnique-trained mechanical engineer.
Overhead, the landmark twin water towers that used to store chemicals for pulp are now empty.
That's because the new process uses heat to soften the wood chips and powerful metal disks to
grind them into pulp, so the mill smells pleasantly of sawdust.
The new pulp refiner has cut greenhousegas emissions by 54 per cent, water use by 34 per cent
and organic waste by 40 per cent, earning the mill a first-place Eco-geste award from the Quebec
Environment Department in 2003.
It also eliminated 55 per cent of the jobs: 221 work here compared with 485 seven years ago.
The plant now recycles 98 per cent of its solid waste; wood scraps are sent out to make particle
board and organic waste is composted and trucked out to farmers' fields. All liquid euent is treated
to remove pollutants before it is returned to the du Lievre River, which 
ows into the Ottawa River
1.5 kilometres downstream. \It's crazy, until 1985 we dumped everything back in the river," says
Bussiere, whose first ambition was to work in the environmental field.
But the massive refiner's powerful, 36megawatt motor | \ like a Boeing," Bussiere notes |
consumes enormous amounts of energy | and wood.
When the James Maclaren Company, a local lumber dynasty, opened the mill in 1930, the
abundant forest that once grew here kept it supplied with pulp logs.
\The du Lievre River runs through a pine region, and vast forests of spruce are waiting for the
woodsman's axe and the pulp mill and paper mill," the Toronto Globe reported in 1895. \There is
sufficient spruce standing on the banks of this river to supply the largest paper mill in the world
at the present time for a hundred years, so that it might be truthfully stated that the supply is
inexhaustible."
But the inexhaustible forest was logged out years ago.
Nowadays, wood chips | the mill's raw material | come from the Abitibi and northern Lau-
rentians, a trip of up to seven hours by truck.
Out in the yard, a 66-foot semi-trailer | one of 240 that arrive every week, laden with chips
| is preparing to dump its 20-tonne load. The rig drives onto a mechanized ramp that, like some
robotic Godzilla, rises into the air, raising the massive truck almost perpendicular to the ground
until its contents spill out. A conveyor belt carries the wood chips to the pulper.
The chips are a sawmill by-product made from remnants too small for lumber, Bussiere explains.
Up to 85 per cent of the fibre used to make pulp in Canada comes from wood chips, says Jean-
Pierre Martel, senior vice-president of sustainability at the Forest Products Association of Canada.
\ In the 1960s and ' 70s, it was all pulp logs."
Martel said the forestry industry has made great strides in making logging more sustainable.
In Canada, 94 per cent of forest is publicly owned and 85 per cent is certified under one of three
systems that ensure logging companies take preservation of natural ecosystems into account. This
includes reducing impact on waterways and preserving wildlife habitat.
\Less than seven per cent of the world forest is third-party certified," Martel noted.
But Tracy London, newspaper campaigner for Markets Initiative, says the vast volume of wood
used to feed the pulp and paper industry is cause for concern.
Canada is the world's largest producer and exporter of newsprint and wood pulp, producing 7.8
million tonnes of newsprint and 25.2 million tonnes of pulp and 6.7 million tonnes of printing and
writing paper in 2005, according to the federal government report, The State of Canada's Forests
2005-06.

Jim Fyles, McGill University professor and scientific director of the Sustainable Forest Manage-
ment Network, said awareness of the importance of maintaining forest ecosystems has improved in
the forestry industry.
\There is a good understanding in order to have a sustainable forest you need to replace the
trees that are cut."
But Fyles says scientists are uncertain about how much harvesting of the forest should be
allowed. \We need to be able to sustain the forest because it sustains a lot of people."
Inside the mill, the paper machine is spinning out 1,300 metres of newsprint a minute. Circular
saws slice the 8.3-metrewide roll into custom widths ordered by customers.
The rolls coming out the paper-winder now are for the Chicago Sun-Times and Philadelphia
Newspapers Inc., which publishes the Philadelphia Inquirer and Daily News. Someday soon, readers
in Philly and Chicago will be poring over the now pristine paper gliding on a conveyor belt to the
shipping area.
Pressman Pierre Belanger joined The Gazette when Expo 67 was still in the planning and Mother
Martin's was the watering hole of choice for thirsty Gazette stauters.
Forty years and two printing presses later, Belanger, 60, figures the 2002 move to the newspaper's
purpose-built printing plant on St. Jacques St. W. in Notre Dame de Grace was his last.
\Once you have a taste of that, you don't want to go back," he says of the two computer-
controlled outset presses that now print The Gazette.
Technological upgrades have also saved costs and reduced environmental impacts, says Des-
marteaux.
Soy-based inks have replaced petroleum products The Gazette used in the 1960vintage letter
press at its former location in Old Montreal. That has significantly reduced emissions of volatile
organic compounds (VOC), once a common by-product of the printing industry.
Vegetable inks also reduce toxic waste when newspapers are recycled.
And computerization recently eliminated the need for film, and the chemicals used to process
it, in the printing process.
In the past two decades, The Gazette has cut newsprint consumption almost in half | 17,000
tonnes last year, compared to 31,000 tonnes in 1987.
The savings are due to fewer pages and a switch to a smaller broadsheet.
Desmarteaux estimates the paper will use 15,000 tonnes of newsprint this year.
\This is three weeks of inventory," she says, indicating the humidity-controlled storage area
where gigantic rolls of newsprint are stacked six high.
The newer presses have also eliminated waste at the start of each press run | 1,500 copies are
scrapped compared to three times that on the old press, Desmarteaux adds.
After printing | a complex ballet where colour and black-and-white pages somehow sort them-
selves into their proper sections | the newspaper is cut, folded, bundled and transported by con-
veyor belt to the loading dock.
Delivery: adults in cars
While the city sleeps, Mike Rautoul checks his watch. \They should have started at 2," he frets.
It's 2:30 a.m. and the presses at The Gazette's St. Jacques St. plant still haven't started
printing the Saturday sports final | the last edition of the paper, which goes to homes and stores
in central Montreal.
Rautoul is an independent contractor responsible for making sure 40,000 subscribers from St.
Leonard to Lachine get their Gazettes on time.

He's among 13 distributors who employ 60 subcontractors and 800 carriers to deliver the paper.
The distribution contractors' 80 trucks and the carriers' 800 cars travel a total of about 22,000
kilometres every day.
If the paper comes out the press late, Rautoul and his army of 500 carriers will have to make up
the time.
On top of that, it's raining and this morning's paper is thicker than usual because of a special
advertising supplement.
\All we need is a good snowstorm and we're all set," Rautoul quips.
Twenty-five years ago, kids on foot delivered most Gazettes and other newspapers across North
America.
District managers driving Gazette vans dropped out the bundles at carrier's homes or at drop
points.
But since the early 1990s, The Gazette has been delivered by adults in cars and today's routes
are five times bigger | 200 to 300 homes | than they were 25 years ago.
Suburban sprawl, the death of afternoon papers, contracting-out of newspaper distribution and
parents who don't let kids go out unsupervised have all contributed to the change, Rautoul says.
He supplies the plastic bags to protect newspapers in wet weather. Carriers pay 1.5 cents per
bag. Rautoul knows biodegradable bags would be better for the environment but doesn't want to
increase carriers' costs.
At the Rose Bowl parking lot at St. Jacques St. and Cavendish Blvd., 25 carriers are already
waiting in their idling cars for bundles.
Among them is Gabriel, a 37-year-old father of two who came to Canada from Romania three
years ago. He also happens to be my paper carrier. Gabriel is one of the few carriers who actually
walks his route.
He starts at 4 a.m., finishes by 6, then drives his kids to school and goes to his day job as an
accounts-receivable clerk.
\It's like jogging," says Gabriel, who picks up the bundles in his 2005 Corolla, then parks and
delivers the papers on foot.
He was thinking of quitting the route recently but decided he actually enjoys the pre-dawn
workout.
\I realized it's not just for the money, it's for me."
