I saw a dull and scary movie .
It was a mess and a hazard .
a perfect example of rancid , well-intentioned , but shamelessly manipulative movie making .
the story itself is ludicrous and uninteresting and so are its elements .
it has low impact but it's a compelling story .
however this movie's execution is completely unacceptable .
